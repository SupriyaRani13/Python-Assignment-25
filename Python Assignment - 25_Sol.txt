1. What is the difference between enclosing a list comprehension in square brackets and
parentheses?

Sol: n Python, both square brackets [] and parentheses () can be used with list comprehensions, but they have slightly different effects.

1. Square Brackets []:
When you enclose a list comprehension in square brackets, it creates a new list and populates it with the values generated by the comprehension. The result is a list containing the items processed by the comprehension.

result = [expression for item in iterable if condition]


2. Parentheses ():
When you use parentheses with a list comprehension, it actually creates a generator expression. A generator expression doesn't create the entire list in memory at once like a list comprehension. Instead, it generates the values one by one as needed, which can be memory-efficient for large datasets. You can iterate over a generator expression 

result_generator = (expression for item in iterable if condition)

Using Square Brackets:-

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared_list = [x ** 2 for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0]
print(squared_list)  # Output: [4, 16]


Using Parentheses (Generator Expression):-

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared_generator = (x ** 2 for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0)
print(squared_generator)  # Output: <generator object <genexpr> at 0x...>
print(list(squared_generator))  # Output: [4, 16]


2. What is the relationship between generators and iterators?

Sol: Iterator:
An iterator is an object that implements the methods __iter__() and __next__(). The __iter__() method returns the iterator object itself, and the __next__() method returns the next value from the iterator. When there are no more items to be returned, the __next__() method raises the StopIteration exception to signal the end of iteration.


Generator:
A generator is a special type of iterator that is created using a function with one or more yield statements. When a function contains a yield statement, it becomes a generator function. When the generator function is called, it doesn't execute immediately like a regular function. Instead, it returns a generator object that can be iterated over.

EG- def countdown(n):
    while n > 0:
        yield n
        n -= 1

# Using the generator
counter = countdown(5)
for i in counter:
    print(i)  # Outputs: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1



3. What are the signs that a function is a generator function?

Sol: Use of the yield Keyword: The most important sign of a generator function is the presence of one or more yield statements within the function body. These yield statements are used to yield values from the generator function.

Function Behavior: When you call a generator function, it doesn't execute the function body immediately. Instead, it returns a generator object without executing the function code. The function's execution is deferred until you start iterating over the generator or explicitly call the generator's methods like __next__() (or next() function).

Pausing and Resuming Execution: Inside a generator function, when a yield statement is encountered, the function's execution is paused at that point. The yielded value is returned to the caller, and the function's state is saved. When the generator is iterated again (using a loop or explicitly), the function resumes execution from where it was paused, continuing to the next yield statement.


Eg - def countdown(n):
    while n > 0:
        yield n
        n -= 1

# Using the generator
counter = countdown(5)
for i in counter:
    print(i)  # Outputs: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1




4. What is the purpose of a yield statement?

Sol: Lazy and On-Demand Generation: The primary purpose of the yield statement is to enable lazy and on-demand generation of values. When a generator function is called, it doesn't execute the entire function body immediately. Instead, it returns a generator object that can be used to iterate over the values. Each time the generator is iterated, the function's execution is paused at the yield statement, and the yielded value is returned to the caller. This allows the generator to produce values one at a time as they are needed, which can be memory-efficient and useful for dealing with large datasets or infinite sequences.

Maintaining State: The yield statement also plays a crucial role in maintaining the state of the generator function between calls. When the function's execution is paused at a yield statement, its local variables and execution context are preserved. This means that when the generator function is resumed, it continues from where it left off, allowing it to generate the next value in the sequence.


Eg - def countdown(n):
    while n > 0:
        yield n
        n -= 1

# Using the generator
counter = countdown(5)
print(next(counter))  # Output: 5
print(next(counter))  # Output: 4
print(next(counter))  # Output: 3


5. What is the relationship between map calls and list comprehensions? Make a comparison and
contrast between the two.

Sol: Map() Function:

The map() function applies a given function to each item in an iterable (like a list) and returns an iterator that yields the results. The syntax is:-

map(function, iterable)


Pros:

Can be memory-efficient because it produces values one by one as needed.
Useful when you want to apply the same function to every element in the iterable.
Cons:

Requires a separate function to be defined or passed as an argument.
Can sometimes be less readable when dealing with complex operations.


Eg - numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared = map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers)
# squared is an iterator, so convert it to a list to see the result
squared_list = list(squared)
print(squared_list)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]


List Comprehensions:

List comprehensions provide a concise way to create new lists by performing an operation on each item in an iterable. The syntax is:-

new_list = [expression for item in iterable]

Eg - numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared_list = [x ** 2 for x in numbers]
print(squared_list)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

Both map() and list comprehensions are ways to transform data in a collection.
List comprehensions are often more readable and easier to write for simple transformations.
map() can be more memory-efficient as it yields values one by one, while list comprehensions create a new list.
map() requires a function to be defined or passed, whereas list comprehensions directly show the transformation expression.
If you need to apply a function with multiple arguments or functions from multiple modules, map() can be more versatile.
List comprehensions can include conditional statements for filtering elements, making them more flexible in some scenarios.
